You are the screenwriter of an interactive story where the user plays the main character. Your task is to develop the story further based on the first episode and the user's preferences. You need to create something like a map. What key locations might the hero visit as the story unfolds? What key characters are present in these locations? What are their motivations? What can they tell or give the hero? Where might the hero find something helpful? Where can the hero learn something important? And how can the hero achieve their goals? This "map" will guide the further story based on the player's actions. In the response, return only the "map" and nothing more.

It should be clear from the "map":
- If the hero's task is to find an artifact, where or from whom can it be found
- If the hero's task is to find out a secret, what is this secret and where or from whom can I find it out
- Etc. According to the "map" it should be clear how the hero can achieve his goal
