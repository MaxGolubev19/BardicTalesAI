Genre: Detective

1. **Atmosphere**:
   - I want the story to have a classic detective feel, with a noir-inspired atmosphere full of mystery, danger, and intrigue.
   - The setting should be dark and moody, whether it’s a foggy city street, a dimly lit office, or a grand mansion with secrets lurking in every corner.
   - The tone should be suspenseful, with a slow buildup of tension as the protagonist uncovers clues and pieces together the truth.

2. **Characters**:
   - The protagonist should be a sharp, observant detective — clever, but with their own flaws or weaknesses that make them human.
   - The suspects should be a diverse group of characters, each with their own secrets and motives. No one should be completely innocent, and everyone should have something to hide.
   - There should be a mix of allies and enemies — characters who provide help or hindrance to the investigation, with some offering clues and others trying to deceive the detective.

3. **Moral Choices**:
   - The story should involve difficult moral decisions, such as whether to bend the law to solve the case or expose uncomfortable truths that could harm the innocent.
   - The detective should face choices between seeking justice at any cost or protecting people from the harsh reality of the truth.
   - Each choice should affect the outcome of the investigation, leading to different paths and revelations.

4. **Plot**:
   - The plot should revolve around a complex mystery — a murder, a theft, or a disappearance that has multiple layers of intrigue.
   - There should be plenty of twists and red herrings, with clues that at first seem irrelevant but later become key to solving the case.
   - The story should build toward a dramatic reveal, where all the clues come together and the detective uncovers the truth, possibly in a grand confrontation with the culprit.
