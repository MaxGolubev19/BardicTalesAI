1. **Atmosphere**:
   - I want the story to be dark and immersive.
   - The world should be cruel, filled with betrayal and violence.
   - There should be a strong sense of loneliness and hopelessness.

2. **Characters**:
   - All characters should be morally ambiguous, with no clear heroes or villains.
   - Each character should have hidden motives that can influence the plot.
   - I am interested in characters who are difficult to trust and may betray the protagonist.

3. **Moral Choices**:
   - The story should include complex moral dilemmas.
   - Every choice should have heavy consequences, with no “right” or “wrong” decisions.
   - I want all of the protagonist’s actions to have a lasting impact on the world and the plot.

4. **Plot**:
   - The story should be filled with struggles for survival and power.
   - There should be no easy victories — everything should come at a cost.
   - The protagonist should face difficult decisions and impossible choices.
