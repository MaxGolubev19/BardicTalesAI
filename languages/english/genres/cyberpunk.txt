1. **Atmosphere**:
   - The world should be dark and high-tech, where technology is advanced, but the lives of ordinary people are full of danger and injustice.
   - I want to feel the decay, overcrowding, and social inequality, where megacorporations control everything and the government is corrupt.
   - It’s important that the protagonist is surrounded by neon lights, dark streets, and a constant sense of threat.

2. **Characters**:
   - Characters should come from different strata of society: from corporate employees and mercenaries to hackers and underground freedom fighters.
   - Each character should have their own agenda, hidden motives, and willingness to betray if it benefits them.
   - I want to see strong but broken heroes, struggling with moral dilemmas, not perfect individuals.

3. **Moral Choices**:
   - The story should include complex moral decisions, where no choice is truly "right."
   - Each decision should affect the environment and relationships with characters.
   - I want the protagonist's actions to impact the world, but it should always come at a personal cost or compromise.

4. **Plot**:
   - The story should be filled with elements of cyberspace, hacking intrusions, and power struggles.
   - The protagonist should face off against megacorporations that manipulate the city and society for their own ends.
   - Let the story explore themes of technology altering humanity, cybernetic enhancements, and the loss of one’s humanity.
