Genre: Space Opera

1. **Atmosphere**:
   - I want the story to take place in a vast galaxy filled with strange planets, quirky alien species, and epic space battles.
   - The tone should be lighthearted and humorous, balancing the high-stakes drama of space with moments of comedic relief and absurd situations.
   - I enjoy settings where advanced technology and intergalactic politics are treated with a bit of humor — spaceships that malfunction at the worst possible times, or overly bureaucratic alien civilizations.

2. **Characters**:
   - The characters should be diverse and colorful, including brave (but often bumbling) space captains, eccentric alien sidekicks, and sarcastic robots.
   - Each character should have a funny or exaggerated personality trait, like a fearless bounty hunter with terrible aim or a scientist who is afraid of flying.
   - I want character interactions to be full of witty banter, humorous misunderstandings, and unlikely alliances formed in the face of danger.

3. **Moral Choices**:
   - The choices should often have humorous consequences, where the "right" decision might lead to something unexpected or ridiculous (e.g., saving a planet from invasion, but accidentally causing an intergalactic diplomatic incident).
   - The protagonist should face dilemmas that balance heroism with personal gain, often with comedic results.
   - Every choice should still advance the plot, but the outcomes should lean into the absurdity of life in space.

4. **Plot**:
   - The plot should revolve around epic space adventures, like rescuing a kidnapped alien princess or stopping a galactic war — but with plenty of humorous twists.
   - Let the protagonist and crew face ridiculous challenges, like navigating a ship through a field of sentient asteroids or trying to outwit a villain with an over-the-top evil plan.
   - The story should explore themes of adventure, loyalty, and the chaos of space travel, all while keeping the tone fun and entertaining.
