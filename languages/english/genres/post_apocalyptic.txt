Genre: Post-apocalyptic

1. **Atmosphere**:
   - The world should be devastated by a catastrophe (war, virus, natural disasters, etc.), and humanity is on the edge of survival.
   - It’s important that everything feels abandoned, desolate, and dangerous, with scarce resources and constant threats.
   - I want to feel that the world is drowning in despair, where every day is a fight for survival, and hope is nearly gone.

2. **Characters**:
   - All characters should be survivors, each with their own story of how they made it through the catastrophe.
   - Characters should be hardened and embittered by survival, and any of them could become either enemies or allies depending on the circumstances.
   - Every character should carry a sense of loss, fear of the future, and a readiness to go to extreme lengths to survive.

3. **Moral Choices**:
   - The protagonist should face difficult moral decisions: help others at the risk of their own life, or take everything for themselves?
   - Every choice should have consequences — lack of resources, betrayal, or the possibility of finding allies.
   - The character should regularly confront the dilemma: what is more important — humanity or survival?

4. **Plot**:
   - The story should be filled with the search for resources, battles over territory, and encounters with dangerous groups and mutants.
   - The protagonist should fight for their survival and perhaps for the salvation of the remaining people, but every step should be difficult and dangerous.
   - The plot should explore themes of civilization’s downfall, loss of humanity, and the hope for rebuilding the world.
