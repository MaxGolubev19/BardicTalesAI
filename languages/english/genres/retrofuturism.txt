Genre: Retrofuturism

1. **Atmosphere**:
   - I want the world to feel like a vision of the future from the 1950s — sleek, shiny, and full of optimism, but with underlying societal flaws.
   - The environment should have a retro aesthetic, with flying cars, ray guns, and atomic-powered robots, but technology often has limitations or unintended consequences.
   - The story should balance the excitement of technological advancement with themes of over-reliance on machines and the impact of unchecked progress on society.

2. **Characters**:
   - Characters should be futuristic yet nostalgic, such as daring space explorers, eccentric scientists, or robotic companions with quirky personalities.
   - I want a mix of optimistic dreamers and cynical individuals who see the cracks in the utopian vision of the future.
   - The protagonist should often interact with advanced but flawed technology, and the characters around them should reflect both the excitement and dangers of living in a tech-dominated world.

3. **Moral Choices**:
   - The story should explore choices around the use and control of technology. Should progress be allowed to continue unchecked, or should humanity take a step back?
   - Every choice should reflect the balance between technological advancement and the social or environmental costs associated with it.
   - I want the protagonist to deal with dilemmas that question the role of technology in human life — should we trust machines to solve our problems, or does that come at too high a price?

4. **Plot**:
   - The plot should involve futuristic adventures with a retro twist — space travel, robot revolutions, and technological mysteries.
   - Let the protagonist uncover the hidden dangers of seemingly perfect technologies, whether it's malfunctioning robots or hidden government control.
   - The story should explore how the promise of a "better future" may lead to unintended consequences, as society becomes more dependent on automation and innovation.
