Genre: Dystopia

1. **Atmosphere**:
   - I want the world to feel oppressive and controlled, where the government or a powerful entity exerts total control over the population.
   - The atmosphere should be bleak and hopeless, with the protagonist constantly under surveillance, facing restrictions on their freedom and individuality.
   - The setting should include advanced technology used to monitor and manipulate people, with a strong contrast between the ruling elite and the oppressed masses.

2. **Characters**:
   - The protagonist should be someone struggling to find their identity or freedom in a world that suppresses individual thought and creativity.
   - Other characters should include enforcers of the system, rebels, and ordinary people who either conform to or resist the system in different ways.
   - There should be morally ambiguous characters who make the protagonist question their own beliefs, as well as potential allies who may have their own hidden agendas.

3. **Moral Choices**:
   - The choices should revolve around defying or accepting the system — the protagonist must decide whether to take risks to fight for freedom or stay safe within the system’s rules.
   - Each choice should have consequences for the protagonist’s relationships, survival, and sense of identity, often with no clear right or wrong answer.
   - The protagonist should face dilemmas about trust — who to believe and who might betray them, with many characters having hidden motives.

4. **Plot**:
   - The plot should focus on the protagonist’s journey to uncover the truth behind the oppressive system — whether it’s discovering the true purpose of the ruling regime or exposing a conspiracy.
   - There should be dangerous missions, undercover operations, and moments of intense surveillance where the protagonist is constantly being watched.
   - The story should build toward a climactic confrontation, where the protagonist either attempts to overthrow the system or is faced with an impossible choice about their own fate and the fate of the world.
